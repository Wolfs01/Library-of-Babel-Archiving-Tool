# Library-of-Babel-Archiving-Tool

This script is used to find an according book page to your input text in the library of babel and save the location on your PC so you can find it again.

This is useless

COMMANDS:

archive       [path of text file] [path of archive file] default: date + time          
  -searches input file in the library of babel and returns location entry

find          [path of archive file]                                                   
  -takes in location entry and opens the page in your standard webbrowser

quit / exit                                                                            
  -guess what









Inspiration: 

I wanted to start writing a diary in the library of babel and the fact that you couldn't use ENTER in the search field midly inconvenienced me into procrasting to actually start the diary and write this (it calculates how many spaces need to be added at the end of a line for eventually looking good in the library of babel)
